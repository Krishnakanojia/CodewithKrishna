/*Hii my name Krishna
I learn web developement but,
I got it one problem can you solve it 
Problem say that:

Given an array of integer,find if the 
contains any duplicate number.
Your function should return true if any
value appears at least twice in the array
and it should return false if every element 
is distinct*/
//Example:- input:[1,2,3,1]
//Output:true
//Duplicate number is 1
